# Timer project

Timer Application.

Users have the option to:

- Start the timer by pressing the start button.
- When the user presses "Start", the word "Start" changes to "Stop". The user can then press the stop button to stop the timer.
- Click on the gear icon to change the duration (in minutes and seconds) of the timer. The gear icon changes to a tick, pressing which returns the timer to its previous state.
- For numbers less than 10, there should be 0 before each number (after the start)
- After the timer expires, the ring changes from green to red, and an alert is sent to the browser.
